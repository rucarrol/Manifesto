# Manifesto

Network Engineers Manifesto 

### Key motivating factors:

- Data driven decisions.
- Excellence in all things. 
- Technical depth and no technology religion 
- Clarity of vision, clarity of execution 
- Lead the business in decisions related to transportation of packets
- Dedication to all our customers  
- "Good enough" is too low a bar


### [Monitoring](Monitoring.md) 

- Monitor, from outside:
    - Implement end-to-end tests (eg. server to server, enduser connections to DC)
    - Make use of external monitoring services mentioned in [Monitoring](Monitoring.md)
- Monitor, at least:
    - Per switch:
        - Interface pps,ups,mps,bitrate,drops,errors,buffer depth
        - CPU, Mem, ICMP messages generated 
        - STP states 
    - Per router:
        - All routing protocol states 
        - Interface pps,ups,mps,bitrate,drops,errors,buffer depth
        - CPU, Mem, ICMP messages generated 
    - Per Firewall:
        - Interface pps,ups,mps,bitrate,drops,errors,buffer depth
        - CPU, Mem, ICMP messages generated 
        - CPS, Throughput
        - Dropped connections 
        - ASIC drops 
    - Per LB
        - Interface pps,ups,mps,bitrate,drops,errors,buffer depth
        - CPU, Mem, ICMP messages generated 
        - CPS, Throughput per VIP 
        - Dropped connections 
        - ASIC drops 
    - Per AP
        - Interface pps,ups,mps,bitrate,drops,errors,buffer depth
        - CPU, Mem, ICMP messages generated 
        - Logged in users, failed login attempts
    - Per Service
        - p99, p95 metrics for service latency:
            - For end to end transaction 
            - For TCP re-transmissions 
            - Latency to/drop server from all DCs
- All monitoring to be a single pane of glass for our users, API driven to allow them to extract their own 


### Documentation

- Everything required to understand the network should be documented
- Documentation must never be out of date.  Automation can help with this
- Use documentation to explain why choices have been made
- Use documentation to explain what other options were rejected

        
### Deployment

- Static routing to be avoided wherever possible
- Zero touch deployment for new gear
- Entirely templated configlets:
    - Base system configuration, including:  AAA, Logging,  
    - OSPF
    - STP 
    - BGP configlets 
    - IPSec tunneling 
- Absolutely no manual configuration pushes to production 
- Design and build a working lab for prototyping configuration 
- Goal to provide an API to our end users to deploy their infrastructure as they see fit  

### Planning for failure
- You need redundancy and failovers
    - Your `[storage|servers|routers|switches|uplinks|etc.]` are going to fail, sometimes in an isolated manner, sometimes in spectacular simultaneous blowouts. Plan for automatic alternatives.
    - Having 3 independent fail safe systems is just fluff if you don't test failover - periodically.

### Remote offices

- Regular random polling of remote users on office internet, general feeling of office network
- Managing this data over time to ensure we have total inclusion of our users 
- Dynamic monitoring and failover of IPSec tunnelling 
- Monthly SLA reporting of WAN performance based on 100% meshed pinging of remote offices 


### Reporting

- Every single SNMP trap has to be actionable 
- Every single packet drop in our network has to be actionable
- Every single TCP re-transmission inside the borders of our administrative control has to be actionable
- Apply predictive algorithms to our graphing to alert of trends before they become issues.


### Personal Development

- everyone must commit to self-improvement
- Certification track - optional but highly recommended 
- Regular hardware deep dives based on freely available vendor documentations, talks, presentations 

##### Temporary solutions

You will often be tempted to make a temporary solution that doesn't pass the smell test, but makes the problem go away for now. Temporary solutions have an unfortunate way of becoming *de facto* permanent. Of course, since the "temporary solution" is *temporary*, it doesn't need to conform to standards, it doesn't need to be thoroughly documented, and since you'll remember it yourself, there's no need to set a followup date to design a proper fix.

Avoid at all reasonable — and even some unreasonable — costs.
